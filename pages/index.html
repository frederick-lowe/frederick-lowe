                    <p>Some dads like to work. Some dads like to watch TV. Some dads like to drink beer. I like all of those things (in balance) but what really lights me up is hiking, biking, and adventuring with my family (and leaving no trace in the places we visit).</p>

                    <p>There's no way to do more adventuring with your family than to go camping with them. So three years ago, we shed our flaming worldly possessions and bought a 5th-wheel to see the world. As we roll into our fourth year there's no end in sight.</p>

                    <p>This post explores an approach I've developed for LLM Meta Prompting which aims to maintain transformer attention by embedding few-shots at the field level.
