            <p>
            	I am (also) Frederick Lowe, a Rad Dad, Full Time Nomad, and Senior Systems Architect. Curious what that means? Read on.

                        <p>Some dads like to work. Some dads like to watch TV. Some dads like to drink beer. I like all of those things (in balance) but what really lights me up is hiking, biking, and adventuring with my wife and kids (and leaving no trace in the places we visit).</p>

                        <p>There's no way to do more adventuring with your family than to go camping with them, so three years ago, we sold or donated our flaming worldly possessions and bought a 5th-wheel to see the world. As we roll into our fourth year there's no end in sight.</p>

                        <p>After 30 years of Web standards evolution, SEO is still often presented as a type of voodoo. Before its spell makes you set money on fire, ask your existing nerds to make sure your Website is (a) performant (b) Web standards adherent and (c) Accessible for people dependent on assistive tech.</p>
